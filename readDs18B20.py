# PURPOSE: - To monitor temperatures within a backup server's 
#            case and within the garden shed it is running in
#          - To turn on heating or cooling if temperature within
#            server case gets out of a predetermined range    
#          - To log temperatures/times in a tab-delimited file
#            on a NAS box.
